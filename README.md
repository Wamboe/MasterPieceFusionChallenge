# MasterPieceFusionChallenge
This a simple project that helps record my favorite movies, and display the ones that have already been saved.

# How it works
You can simply enter the favorite movies on the form on the left beginning with the title and then the main actor.
You can only add one actor on this version. After, you can choose which genre it falls under and again, in this you can choose one genre in this version.
Then hit save to add to the table.

You can view the list on the right. You even have an option of looking for a specific recode based on the title, actor or genre. You just choose what exactly you are searching for, and then key in what you are searching for and hit search.

# To come
- Ability to add more than one actor.
- Ability to add more than one genre.
